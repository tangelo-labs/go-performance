# Go Performance Testing Tool

This repository contains a performance testing tool written in Go. The tool primarily consists of two components: `Runner` and `Summary`.

## Runner

The `Runner` is the main component that executes the performance tests. It is initialized with a test duration, a test function, a rate of calls per second, and a verbosity flag.

The test function is a function that is run on each iteration of the test. This function can be any function that returns an error, allowing for great flexibility in what can be tested.

The `Runner` runs the test function at the specified rate for the specified period of time. It collects statistics about the number of successful and failed tests, as well as the latency of the tests.

## Summary

The `Summary` is a report generated by the `Runner` after the tests are completed. It contains detailed information about the test results, including:

- The total number of tests run
- The total runtime
- The number and percentage of successful tests
- The number and percentage of failed tests
- A breakdown of the errors that occurred
- Test latencies

The `Summary` also calculates and provides latency percentiles to give a better idea of how the test function performed over time.

## Usage

To use this tool, simply import the `performance` package in your Go code, create a new `Runner` with the desired test function and configuration, and then call the `Run` method on the `Runner`.

## Tests

This repository also includes unit tests for the `Runner`. The tests simulate a test function with random latency and error rate to demonstrate how the `Runner` behaves.

## Dependencies

This project depends on several Go packages, which can be found in the `go.mod` file.

## Conclusion

This tool is useful for performing stress tests on Go applications, allowing developers to identify and address performance and reliability issues.
